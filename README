== SeqComplex ==

This is a collection of methods to compute the composition and complexity of a DNA sequence(s) from a Fasta file.

The SeqComplex.pm is a Perl Module containing implementations for each complexity 
measure.  Additional several tools are provided which utilitize this module, they include:
(1) compSeq.pl compute the methods in a windowed mode.
(2) profileComplexSeq.pl compute the methods using the whole sequence.
(3) gatherStats.pl: Example script to run all methods in windowed mode and save raw data
                    for later processing.
(4) displayStats.pl: Example script to read in raw data from gatherStats.pl and 
                     display as either a table or a Google Charts HTML file.
